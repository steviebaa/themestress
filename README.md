# Themestress

The material design 3 library.

## ðŸ“š Check out the [documentation](https://themestress.vercel.app/) here

## ðŸ¤” Purpose

The intention of Themestress is to be a baseline of components built to <a href="https://material.io">Google's Material Design 3</a> specification. The library is inspired by <a href="https://mui.com">Material UI</a> which follows the Material Design 2 guideline.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

The code is <a href="https://github.com/steviebaa/themestress">open source</a>, so you can use the library by copying the `src/themestress` directory to your project (if you'd like to adapt the components) or by installing it via NPM.

Themestress uses <a href="https://emotion.sh/">Emotion</a> to provide an easy styling experience.

```bash
$ npm install themestress @emotion/styled @emotion/react
```
